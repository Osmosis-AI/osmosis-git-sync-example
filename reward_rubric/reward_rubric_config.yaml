    title: Smart Appliance Troubleshooting
    rubric: >
      Score how well the assistant resolves a smart appliance troubleshooting
      request. Reward answers that confirm warranty eligibility, collect
      relevant diagnostics, offer safe and actionable steps, and set clear
      expectations for follow-up service. Penalize answers that ignore the
      user's constraints or invent unsupported policies.
    ground_truth: >
      The assistant should verify the warranty, gather error diagnostics,
      provide safe troubleshooting steps, and schedule timely service if needed.
